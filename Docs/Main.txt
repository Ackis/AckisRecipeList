==Announcement
Hey everyone, it's Ackis writing this.  I've been away from WoW for a while and my good friend Torhal, Ressy and Pompy have been keeping ARL up to date.  I've seen a lot of posts lately that quite frankly have pissed me off.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but the hatred over the decision to break ARL up into modules isn't needed at all.

==Feature Requests/Bug Reporting
Read the [[http://www.wowace.com/addons/arl/pages/feedback-and-bug-reporting/|Bug Reporting and Feature Requesting]] information //before// submitted a bug report or feature request.  Posting reports in the comments is //not// the place to do so.  Ackis had to turn off the comments at [[http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/arl.aspx|Curse.com]] because of constant bug reports and feature requests.  Comments are for questions on how to use the mod, or you can see the thread on [[http://forums.wowace.com/showthread.php?t=11142|WoW Ace]].  Please follow these small little instructions to make our lives easier.  The easier you make development for Ackis Recipe List, the more time we will have to develop other addons.

===Bug Reports
Please use the [[http://www.wowace.com/addons/arl/tickets/|WoW Ace]] tracker to file bug reports.  Posting bugs in the comments is not the place to do it.

===Feature Request
Please use the [[http://www.wowace.com/addons/arl/tickets/|WoW Ace]] tracker to add suggestions and feature requests.  Not all suggestions will be accepted: there are many people who use this addon, each with separate views. We will, however, try to make it as user friendly as possible...but when a decision is made please accept it.

==Integration
Ackis Recipe List strives to integrate with existing trade skill mods out there.  If you have a request for integration, please submit a feature request at [[http://www.wowace.com/addons/arl/tickets/|WoW Ace]].  We make no promises to implement the feature at all.  There is a limited [[http://www.wowace.com/addons/arl/pages/api/|API]] documented to interface with the ARL database.  If you are a developer and would like more functions, please contact us on IRC.
Currently, the mod works with:

Ackis had to turn off the comments at [[http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/arl.aspx|Curse.com]] because of constant bug reports and feature requests.  Comments are for questions on how to use the mod, or you can see the thread on [[http://forums.wowace.com/showthread.php?t=11142|WoW Ace]].  Please follow these small little instructions to make our lives easier.  The easier you make development for Ackis Recipe List, the more time we will have to develop other addons.

==Integration
Ackis Recipe List strives to integrate with existing trade skill mods out there.  If you have a request for integration, please submit a feature request at [[http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/tickets/|WoW Ace]].  We make no promises to implement the feature at all.  There is a limited [[http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/pages/api/|API]] documented to interface with the ARL database.  If you are a developer and would like more functions, please contact us on IRC.

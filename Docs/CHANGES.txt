* Removed the Ammo filter from the recipe list panel.

==== Bug Fixes:

* Added new API functions for custom strings and seasonal recipes.  Updated API documentation.

==== New Features:
* A new slash command has been added: /arl scan <profession>  This will scan the profession from a slash command, without requiring you to open up the tradeskill window yourself.  Due to limitations, this will basically fire off the tradeskill for you so that window will open up. (Ticket 1145)

==== Miscellaneous changes:

* Clicking anywhere outside of the panel will now remove focus from the search editbox.
* It is now possible to list only recipes of certain skill levels by typing the skill level into the search editbox.

==== Database changes:
